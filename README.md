# Image Processing

During my first semester of computer science, we were tasked with creating Adobe Photoshop esc filters on an image. Full disclosure, while the code will work for other images, it is tailored heavily towards the reference image.

I personally put in roughly thirty hours of work into this assignment, and I'm very quite satisfied with it. 

The first filter is all done by me, with the second and third filters being a joint effort by my groupmates and I.
